    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial analysis involves applying statistical analysis to data which has a geographical or geometrical aspect. In this tutorial we'll review the basics of acquiring geospatial data, handling it, and visualizing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how much data contains location as an aspect. Anything in which location makes a difference or can be represented by location is likely going to be a geospatial problem. With different computational tools, we can create beautiful and meaningful visualizations that tell us about how location affects a given trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the specifics, first we'll review some terminology that you should keep in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interior Set\n",
    "\n",
    "An Interior Set is the set of points contained within a geometrical object. If a geometrical object lies on the x-y axis, it contains points inside that object. For example, in the following image, there are two geometric objects and each one contains its own set of interior points. In ABC, its interior set include points like (3,1).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary Set\n",
    "\n",
    "A Boundary Set is the set of points which form the outline of a geometrical object. Boundary Sets and Interior Sets have no intersection. From the previous image, any point that falls on the lines forming the triangles is in that object's boundary set. In ABC, some of those points include (1,3), (5,2), and (4, -1). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exterior Set\n",
    "\n",
    "An Exterior Set is the set of all other points. For example, the point (2,-3) doesn't fall within any geometric object in this example, making it an exterior point. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial data consists of location observations. Spatial data identifies features and positions on the Earthâ€™s surface and is ultimately how we put our observations on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point\n",
    "\n",
    "A Point is a zero-dimensional object representing a single location. Put more simply, they're XY coordinates. Because points are zero-dimensional, they contain exactly one interior point, 0 boundary points, and infinite many exterior points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "A Polygon is a two-dimensional surface stored as a sequence of points defining the exterior. The example from the previous section is an example of a polygon! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "A Curve has an interior set consisting of the infinitely many points along its length, a boundary set consisting of its two end points, and an exterior set of all other points. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "A Surface has an interior set consisting of the infinitely many points within, a boundary set consisting of one or more Curves, and an exterior set of all other points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surfaces have infinite many interior, exterior, and boundary points."
